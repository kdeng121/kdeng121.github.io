                <h4>Problem</h4>
                <p>College is hard. And like any college student, I've spent many tireless nights at the library studying for tests, hoping that the material would magically come to me. What was worse: my friends were not in the same classes as me, so I had nobody to study with. </p>
                <h4>Solution</h4>
                <p> As an advocate for collaborative learning, I took on the initiative to mitigate the fears of asking a stranger in class to study with you. <b>StudyBuds</b> was my simple solution. </p>
                <p>StudyBuds is a web application that allows users to create, view, and search study groups. It was built using the <b>Django</b> framework and <b>PostgreSQL</b> database, written in <b>Python, HTML,</b> and <b>CSS.</b>It uses </p>
                <h4>Usage</h4>
                <p>Found a study group you want to join? Great! Just show up at the location. Didn't find an existing group? No problem. Create one to encourage others to join. And now you won't have to worry about rejection! :)</p>
                <h4>Improvements</h4>
                <p>An improved version would allow users to sign in to manage their personal study groups. In the works...</p>

                <h4>Background</h4>
                <p>The <a href="https://mods.org/">Museum of Discovery and Science</a> in Ft. Lauderdale, FL is known for its fun and interactive exhibits, live animal showcases, and gigantic IMAX theater. Before I became an app developer intern in 11th grade, I volunteered at MODS for the past two years and even attended summer camp at MODS in middle school. It was an exhilerating home away from home.</p>
                <h4>The Internship</h4>
                <p>30 high school juniors across Broward county were selected to participate in a 2-year STEM internship program. We spent the first year analyzing visitor behavior and getting to know the museum's various departments. The largest issue we discovered: <b>most visitors did not bother to read the informational plaques on the wall.</b></p>
                <p>While the museum valued its unique interactive aspect (like fancy flight simulators and gravity demonstrations), we believed that the visitors were not absorbing the actual knowledge to be gained from the exhibits. A <b>MODS Mobile App</b> was our solution to communicate the fun facts more effectively.</p>
                <h4>App Development</h4>
                <p>In Summer 2015, the interns completed the course <i>Android Application Development</i> at Florida Atlantic University. During this course, we split into ten teams of three, with each team developing a portion of the app for a specific exhibit. We built the app using <b>Android Studio</b>, writing in <b>Java</b> and <b>XML</b>.</p>
                <h4>Solution</h4>
                <p>The MODS Mobile App allows visitors to play quiz games, swipe for fun facts, view the floor plan, take a virtual tour, buy IMAX tickets, and keep up-to-date with new special events. In addition to making the visitor experience more convenient, the app provides more engaging methods of learning.</p>

                <h4>Problem</h4>
                <p><a href="https://duuke.org/">Duke University Union</a>, the largest student programming body on campus, hosts Trivia Night every Thursday. All students are welcome to this exciting event, as we typically have a turnout of 50-70 attendees per night. The trivia host collects the unique ID of each participant, but never utilized this data. We couldn't understand why on some nights there were 20 attendees and on other nights there were 100+. </p>
                <h4>Solution</h4>
                <p>I conducted a data analysis project to provide more insight about the Fall 2017 attendee demographics. First, I wrote a <b><a href="http://www.sikuli.org/">Sikuli</a></b> script to automate the process of retrieving student data (such as class year, name, school) from <a href="https://oit.duke.edu/what-we-do/applications/internal-directory">Duke's Directory.</a> Then, using <b>Python</b> and its <b>Plotly</b> library, I created visualizations of key details that are important to the continued success and improvement of trivia night. Lastly, I used <b>HTML, CSS,</b> and <b>Bootstrap</b> template to display the analysis.</p>
                <h4>Why it's important</h4>
                <p>Understanding the frequency of attendees, undergraduate distribution, and total turnout per night can help DUU make the necessary changes that will attract more students. For instance, we could change the day of the week that trivia is held to accomodate generally intense test weeks. Or if there's an imbalance in the class distribution, we could target this event to a specific grade (e.g. sophomores). <b>This is an ongoing project that will lead to more analyses for future semesters and events hosted by DUU.</b></p>

                <p><a href="https://dukeengage.duke.edu/program/zhuhai-china/" >DukeEngage Zhuhai</a> is two-month program that aims to integrate arts education into the curriculum of Zhuhai No. 9 Middle School. During our stay, my team and I designed our own arts courses (such as dance, theater, singing, journalism, photography, and sports) and delivered instruction to the middle school students. Additionally, each Duke student taught oral English courses, focusing on conversational skills and American culture. We hoped that this exposure to subjects out of the children's comfort zone will lead them on a path to continued self-discovery.</p>
                <h4>Personal Thoughts</h4>
                <p>Before the program started, I had many concerns, including the language barrier in China, how the students would react to my teaching, and whether I would have a true impact on my students. I was not expecting that I would get so close to my students. </p>
                <p>While many of them were shy at first, they slowly adapted to Duke's presence and were drawn to us every moment of the school day. By the end of the program, I learned that it wasn't about teaching the children proper grammar or new vocabulary; it was more impactful to show them confidence, to inspire them to realize their potentials, and to encourage them to be fearless of discovering new talents.</p> 
                <p>My role as a teacher slowly developed into the role of a student, as I started to learn about my own passions and to channel my own confidence. During this time, I was living in my host family's house, which made Zhuhai feel like a genuine home filled with rich culture.</p>
                <h4>Why this was meaningful to me</h4>
                <p>Travelling to China for the first time was an important step for me to understand how incredibly diverse the world is. The students' ideologies, cultural values, and perceptions of America were different than what I expected and it was lot of information to absorb.</p>    
                <p>This experience has led me on the path of embracing open-mindedness, as I learned to never judge before I understand the situation. I believe that learning is an endless process and seeking new perspectives will forever humble you. In this world, we need citizens with the heart and soul to persist with humility and an open mind - this will be the key to successful innovation, creativity, and understanding.</p>

                <h4>Pre-college Journey</h4>
                <p>Although I started playing piano in first grade because my parents forced me to, I slowly developed a love for the beautiful instrument. In fifth grade, I signed up to participate in my first piano competition ever. Not expecting anything, I won third place, which inspired me to achieve even greater.</p>
                <p>The years that followed were filled with daily 2-hour practice sessions. Sometimes, I practiced so much that my fingers became sore. But that didn't stop me from wanting to win first place. I knew that discipline and practice was the only way to become the greatest pianist ever. Despite my determination, I was never able to take home the largest first place trophy. Then tenth grade happened.</p>
                <p>I had a good feeling in tenth grade. I was playing my favorite piece to date (Chopin's Ballade No.3) and felt like I matured incredibly in terms of musicality, articulation, and interpretation. I had a spectacular performance at the competition - even my piano teacher loved it (he was a strict teacher who was rarely satisfied). However, as the host was announcing the winners, my heart sank as I received 3rd place. Again.</p>
                <p>"What? But I practiced so hard for this!" was my first thought. But after a few minutes, a unique award was being announced. In honor of the 20th anniversary of the competition, the Chopin Foundation of the United States chose to award the Steinway Young Virtuoso Scholarship to the "most virtuosic pianist who had an extraordinary performance." Seconds later, I found out that I was the winner of this award. </p>
                <p>Receiving this scholarship truly changed my perspective on piano. While it gave me confirmation that my musicality <i>was</i> recognized, it meant much more than that. Music isn't about competition. Music is about creativity and expression, things that are difficult to objectify who the best pianist is. I left that competition with a new attitude towards music and piano.</p>
                
                <h4>What it means to me now</h4>
                <p>Piano is incredible. It is my form of communcation. It is my stress-reliever. It is my inspiration. It is my form of creativity. It is my happy place. It is my motivator. It is my teacher. It is how I express my emotions. It is my passion. I can go on and on with this list. If there's anything you take away from my journey, it is this: <b>piano is who I am.</b></p>
